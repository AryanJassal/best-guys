# The Best Guys

## What is this?

This is a website that is being developed for my Information Processes and Technology course for Year 11. This site is (heavily) inspired by the store [The Good Guys](https://www.thegoodguys.com.au). This site is made using Django, a python web framework to simplify web designing.

## How do I run this?

You can not run this website locally (as of yet). This section will be updated when you will be able to run this locally.

## Notes

The site is meant to be a quick prototype of sorts. When I have extra time, then maybe I can work on improving the code base, but as I am the sole developer and this needs to be done following a strict deadline, some corners might be cut.
